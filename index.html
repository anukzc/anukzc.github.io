									BA in Linguistics, a BS in Mathematics/Computer Science, and a minor in Honors Interdisciplinary Studies. I 
									grew up in Seattle
									but my heritage is Catalan and Argentinian, and I am a speaker of both Catalan and Spanish. I enjoy

												<h3><br/>Arbitrarily Deep Neural Network</h3>
												<p>Pair programmed to implement a customizable neural network from scratch using NumPy and argparse. 
													The NN supports both classification and regression tasks, handles minibatching, and has an optional 
													verbose mode. It accepts data files, hyperparameters, and other settings through the command line for 
													flexible experimentation. Based on the specified report frequency, the program evaluates the model on 
													the development set and prints the performance.

												<h3><br/>Phoneme Classifier</h3>
												<p>I used Scikit-learn's MLPClassifier to create an ensemble model of twelve neural networks. Given 
													vectorized audio inputs, the model classifies it as one of 61 phonemes using probabilistic voting. 
													The four best performing NNs were given more votes, increasing ensemble model performance. I conducted 
													extensive hyperparameter tuning and compared performance across model types. Details can be found in

												<h3><br/>Elizalike Chatbot</h3>

												<h3><br/>WWU Scholars Week 2024</h3>
												<p>I collaborated with another student to conduct phonetic research in Catalan, under the advisement of Dr Jordan 
													Sandoval. We designed a paragraph that contained various instances of our environments of interest, and had 
													five native speakers record themselves reading the paragraph.

													<h3><br/>Menstrual Cycle Tracker</h3>
													<p> This program populates and displays a calendar with given and predicted data, allows the user to 
														input new data, and calculates expected next period and average length of period and menstrual cycle.
														I created additional functionality so that the calendar displays the recorded daily symptoms and 
														intensity as color and size coded dots, providing easily readable and accessible information to the user.
														The user is able to have full control over their medical information, ensuring privacy.

													<h3><br/>Sentence Annotation GUI</h3>
													<p> I designed and implemented a GUI using Tkinter that allows the user to annotate sentences with 
														advisement from Dr Sara Ng. The idea behind this project was to help with language revitalization. 
														For low resource languages, synthetic data can be created in order for these languages to better 
														benefit from language technology. This GUI provides an easy way for native speakers to annotate 
														synthetic sentences and saves their input so that linguists can use that information in their 
														revitalization work.

												<h3><br/>Zombie Videogame</h3>
												<p>I independently created a fully functioning zombie apocalypse themed text-based video game. It provides

													At each step, the player can choose from various actions, which may lead to new choices. The player 
													statistics are updated after each action.

													I collaborate with other students on the morphological transducer team, significantly accelerating progress on what 
													will become a translator. We analyze and input Hän nouns and verbs into the transducer code, correcting errors to ensure 
													translation function and accuracy. I maintain ongoing communication with students and faculty to share progress and challenges.

												<h3><br/>Language Learning Research Group</h3>
												<p>I worked with Drs Jordan Sandoval and Kirsten Drickey to automate the Spanish LLRG's data organization. One step of the group's journey in 
													improving the Spanish program at WWU was to design a Qualtrics survey to collect data from Spanish students. As my Honors Senior 
													Capstone, I created a 
													<a href="https://cedar.wwu.edu/wwu_honors/926/" target="_blank">
														data formatting and plotting app
													</a> that takes the data directly from Qualtrics and can do various tasks with it.
													Depending on the user's selections, the app can clean the data, create a scatter plot of the data with
													various customizable elements, or combine old data with new data into a single file. The link provides a user manual and
													artificial data 
													so that anyone can try the app.
